# News-API

Implemented a Web application that fetches NEWS with help of free API and displays on the web page.

In this project, the concept of API calls is used to get data from free source and use that data to display on my web page.

A link button for 'full article' is present at end in case the user wants to read the entire article and not just the headline.

The project uses Bootstrap Fraemework to customize the user interface ans used JavaScript at Backend for making API calls.

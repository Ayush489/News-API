# News-API

* Implemented a Web application that fetches NEWS with help of free API and displays on the web page.

* In this project, the concept of API calls is used to get data from free source and use that data to display on my web page.

* A link button for 'full article' is present at end in case the user wants to read the entire article and not just the headline.

* The project uses Bootstrap Framework to customize the user interface and uses JavaScript at Backend for making API calls.
